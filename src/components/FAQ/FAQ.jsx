                  At your first consultation, expect a friendly introduction and
                  paperwork. You'll discuss your concerns, undergo assessment,
                  and explore treatment options. Don't hesitate to ask
                  questions. You'll leave with a plan and possibly follow-up
                  appointments.

                  What are Floral Decoration?
                </h1>

                <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-300">
                  Floral decorations are arrangements or displays made primarily
                  from flowers and other natural elements like foliage or
                  branches. They are used to enhance the aesthetic appeal of
                  various settings such as weddings, parties, events, or
                  interior spaces. Floral decorations can take many forms,
                  including bouquets, centerpieces, wreaths, garlands, corsages,
                  boutonnieres, and floral installations. They are designed to
                  evoke specific emotions, complement a theme, or simply add
                  beauty and freshness to any environment.

                  For parking options, we recommend checking the venue's website
                  or contacting them directly as it can vary depending on the
                  location of your event. Many venues offer on-site parking,
                  while others may have nearby parking lots or street parking
                  available. As for public transport options, we encourage
                  guests to utilize public transportation whenever possible for
                  convenience and environmental sustainability. You can
                  typically find information about bus routes, train stations,
                  or subway stops near the venue on public transportation
                  websites or apps. Additionally, consider providing guests with
                  information about public transport options in your event
                  invitations or on your event website to make their travel
                  planning easier.
